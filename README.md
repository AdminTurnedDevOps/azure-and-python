# azure-and-python
All things infrastructure, IaC, automation, and DevOps related  with Azure and Python3

# The Goal
When you think of Azure automation, you think PowerShell. This is true, however, there are other automation tools in place that do the same with a different perspective. The goal of this repository is to provide you with Python code that you would typically write in PowerShell.

# Who is this for?
An automation engineer, sysadmin, cloud engineer, or devops engineer who wants to start getting into Python in the Azure space. Perhaps you already have Python experience, but are unsure of how the SDK in Azure works.
